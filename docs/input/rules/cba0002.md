## Cause

An alias method is available, but have not been marked with a `CakeMethodAlias`
or a `CakePropertyAlias`.

## Rule Description

A violation of this rule occurs when there is a method with the first parameter
that matches (`this ICakeContext`) is available, but have not yet been marked as
an alias by using either `CakeMethodAlias` or a `CakePropertyAlias` attribute.
One of these attributes is required to be used for [Cake](https://cakebuild.net)
to correctly identify and import alias methods.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that there is a `CakeMethodAlias` or a
`CakePropertyAlias` being used on each method that uses `this ICakeContext` as
their first parameter.
_A code fix is provided using the light bulb to make this easier_.

## How to suppress violations

Unless there is a false positive, this rule should **NOT** be suppressed,
but in case of false positive, it can be suppressed in the following ways.

### Changing severity using `.editorconfig`

The severity (and thus suppression) can be changed by using the editorconfig
file by using:

```editorconfig
[*.cs]
# CBA0002: Missing attribute to mark method as an alias.
dotnet_diagnostic.CBA0002.severity = none
```

### Suppress in project file

You can suppress the warning by using the `<NoWarn>` element in the `csproj`
project file.

```xml
<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CBA0002</NoWarn>
```

_NOTE: You may have to open and close the solution for the changes to take effect_.

### Suppressing in code

The violation can be suppressed in code using an attribute (either on class, or global)

```cs
[SuppressMessage("Usage",
                 "CBA0002:Missing attribute to mark method as an alias.",
                 Justification = "False Positive")]
```

Or by using pragma

```cs
#pragma warning disable CBA0002 // Missing attribute to mark method as an alias.
#pragma warning restore CBA0002 // Missing attribute to mark method as an alias.
```
