> Cake aliases should be marked with a category to be discovered more easily on <https://cakebuild.net>

## Cause

An alias class without the `CakeAliasCategory` attribute was found.

## Rule Description

A violation of this rule occurs when there is a class that ends with `Alias` or
`Aliases` that have not been marked with a `CakeAliasCategory` attribute.
This attribute is recommended to be used to document in which category the adding
is under.

## How to fix violations

To fix a violation of this rule, ensure that there is a `CakeAliasCategory`
(namespace `Cake.Core.Annotations`) available on every alias class.
_A code fix is provided using the light bulb to make this easier._

## How to suppress violations

It is not generally recommended to suppress this violation,
and false flags should be reported in the respective repository.

## Changing severity using `.editorconfig`

The severity (and thus suppression) can be changed by using the
editorconfig file by using:

```editorconfig
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.CBA0001.severity = none
```

### Suppress in project file

You can suppress the warning by using the `<NoWarn>` element in the `csproj`
project file.

```xml
<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CBA0001</NoWarn>
```

_NOTE: You may have to open and close the solution for the changes to take effect_.

### Suppressing in code

The violation can be suppressed in code using an attribute (either on class, or global)

```cs
[SuppressMessage("Documentation",
                 "CBA0001:Missing Cake Alias Category",
                 Justification = "False Positive")]
```

Or by using pragma

```cs
#pragma warning disable CBA0001 // Missing Cake Alias Category
#pragma warning restore CBA0001 // Missing Cake Alias Category
```
